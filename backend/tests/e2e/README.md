# End-to-End Tests for RefMemTree Integration

These E2E tests verify RefMemTree's complete integration in Codorch.

---

## 🎯 What E2E Tests Cover

### 1. PostgreSQL ↔ RefMemTree Sync
- Module creation syncs to both
- Dependency creation updates both
- Updates propagate correctly
- Deletes clean up both

### 2. Rule Engine Protection
- Rules loaded from DB
- Validation before writes
- Invalid operations blocked
- Clear error messages

### 3. Impact Analysis
- Detect affected modules
- Calculate architectural weight
- Warn before breaking changes
- Block critical deletions

### 4. AI Governor Safety
- Plan validation works
- Dry-run simulation
- Atomic execution
- Auto-rollback on failure

### 5. Real-time Monitoring
- Monitors setup on project open
- Alerts trigger correctly
- WebSocket notifications
- Change propagation

### 6. Analytics Performance
- Instant queries (< 100ms)
- Complex analyses work
- Critical node detection
- Health score calculation
