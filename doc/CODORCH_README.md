+# 🎭 Codorch
+
+**AI-Powered Business Orchestration Platform**
+
+> *Orchestrating Ideas into Reality*
+
+---
+
+## What is Codorch?
+
+**Codorch** (Code Orchestrator) transforms business ideas into production-ready applications through intelligent AI orchestration. Unlike project management tools that just track tasks, or AI code generators that work in isolation, Codorch **remembers everything** about your project and intelligently guides you from initial concept through architecture to working code.
+
+### The Problem We Solve
+
+Building software projects is hard:
+- ❌ Requirements get lost or forgotten
+- ❌ Context is scattered across docs, chats, and code
+- ❌ Decisions aren't documented with their reasoning
+- ❌ Past learnings don't carry forward
+- ❌ AI tools lack project context
+- ❌ Teams reinvent solutions that already exist
+
+### The Codorch Solution
+
+✅ **Photographic Memory** - Never forget why you made decisions  
+✅ **Intelligent Orchestration** - AI guides you through every phase  
+✅ **Safe Experimentation** - Branch and try alternatives risk-free  
+✅ **Context-Aware AI** - AI that understands your entire project  
+✅ **Knowledge Compounds** - Learn from every project forever  
+
+---
+
+## 🚀 Key Features
+
+### 1. 🎯 Goal Definition & Analysis
+Define your business goals and let AI analyze them for clarity, feasibility, and completeness using SMART methodology.
+
+### 2. 💡 Opportunity Generation
+AI generates and evaluates multiple business opportunities based on your goals, market context, and past successes.
+
+### 3. 🔍 Intelligent Research
+Context-aware research sessions that remember what you already know and focus on discovering new insights.
+
+### 4. 🏗️ Architecture Designer
+Visual drag-and-drop architecture editor with AI-generated initial designs, dependency tracking, and impact analysis.
+
+### 5. 📋 Requirements Management
+Detailed requirements tracking with AI validation for completeness, clarity, and technical feasibility.
+
+### 6. 💻 Code Generation
+Context-aware code generation that understands your architecture, requirements, and coding patterns.
+
+### 7. 🌲 RefMemTree - The Brain
+Hierarchical memory management that gives AI perfect context awareness across your entire project history.

+
+## 🧠 What Makes Codorch Different?
+
+### The Secret: RefMemTree
+
+**RefMemTree** is Codorch's brain - an intelligent memory system that:
+
+- 📚 **Remembers Everything**: Every decision, discussion, and discovery
+- 🔗 **Connects Context**: Semantic relationships across your project
+- 🌿 **Enables Branching**: Experiment without fear of losing work
+- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information instantly
+- 📸 **Snapshots History**: Travel back to any decision point
+- 🎯 **Adapts to Task**: Optimizes context for each AI operation
+
+**Impact**: 10-20x more effective AI agents compared to traditional approaches.
+
+### RefMemTree in Action
+
+```python
+# Traditional AI (no context)
+"Generate a login module"
+→ Generic, may not fit your project
+
+# Codorch with RefMemTree
+context = tree.get_smart_context(current_module)
+# AI now knows:
+# - Your project's authentication strategy
+# - Related modules and dependencies  
+# - Past successful implementations
+# - Your coding patterns and preferences
+→ Perfect fit, contextually relevant code
+```
+
+---
+
+## 🎬 How It Works
+
+### The Codorch Journey
+
+```
+1. Define Goal
+   ↓ (AI analyzes and suggests improvements)
+   
+2. Generate Opportunities  
+   ↓ (AI creates alternatives, you choose best)
+   
+3. Research & Validate
+   ↓ (AI researches, remembers insights)
+   
+4. Design Architecture
+   ↓ (AI generates, you refine visually)
+   
+5. Define Requirements
+   ↓ (AI validates for completeness)
+   
+6. Generate Code
+   ↓ (AI creates contextually perfect code)
+   
+7. Production-Ready Application
+   🎉
+```
+
+**At every step**: 
+- AI suggests based on full context
+- You review and approve
+- Codorch remembers the "why"
+- Knowledge compounds for next project
