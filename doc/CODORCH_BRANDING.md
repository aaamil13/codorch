+## 🏆 Competitive Advantage
+
+### vs Traditional PM Tools (Jira, Linear, etc.):
+- ❌ They track tasks → ✅ Codorch orchestrates intelligence
+- ❌ They forget context → ✅ Codorch remembers everything
+- ❌ They're flat → ✅ Codorch is hierarchical with semantic connections
+- ❌ No AI integration → ✅ AI at every step
+
+### vs AI Code Generators (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.):
+- ❌ They work at code level → ✅ Codorch works from idea to code
+- ❌ No project context → ✅ Full project memory (RefMemTree)
+- ❌ Single-shot generation → ✅ Iterative, orchestrated process
+- ❌ No requirement tracking → ✅ Full requirements lifecycle
+
+### vs No-Code Platforms:
+- ❌ Limited flexibility → ✅ Full code generation capability
+- ❌ Vendor lock-in → ✅ Export to standard code
+- ❌ Black box → ✅ Full transparency and control
+- ❌ Can't handle complexity → ✅ Scales to enterprise projects
+
+**Codorch is the MISSING LINK between idea and implementation.**
